# Sample Project Made with Purely Bevy

**DISCLAIMER:**  
This is currently a Work In Progress and is not suitable for enterprise use yet.

## Introduction

This project is a game framework built using Bevy, a powerful and flexible game engine in Rust. The framework demonstrates various game mechanics and systems that can be adapted for different genres and use cases. This project is still under development and is meant for experimentation and learning purposes.

## Features

### Safe-Network Sync System
A robust networking system that ensures secure synchronization across devices. It leverages reliable and efficient methods for real-time multiplayer support, with built-in safety checks to avoid common network-related issues.

### Gaussian-Splatting Collision Resources
An innovative collision detection system powered by Gaussian-splatting techniques, offering improved performance and flexibility for collision detection in complex 3D environments.

### A FPS-like Mini-game example
An FPS-inspired mini-game where players control a character, navigate through an environment, and interact with objects. It includes features like camera control, player movement, and interactions.

### A Civilization VI-like Mini-game example
A turn-based strategy mini-game inspired by **Civilization VI**, where players can build civilizations, manage resources, and explore the world. It aims to replicate some of the strategic mechanics seen in classic civilization-building games.

### A League of Legends-like Mini-game example
A mini-game inspired by **League of Legends**, focusing on team-based gameplay, character abilities, and strategic decision-making. This game mode brings action-packed, fast-paced matches to players.

### WASM-Compilable Methods
The framework is designed to compile to **WebAssembly (WASM)**, enabling it to run directly in web browsers. This allows for cross-platform play and easy distribution of the game through web-based platforms.

### Offline-LLM Game Integration (Slow, But Useful)
A local integration with **tiny-LLM**, providing AI-driven game mechanics for offline gameplay. While the performance might be slow, it offers useful features like dynamic decision-making, intelligent NPCs, and procedural generation for Civilization VI-like mechanics.

## Resources

### Made with Few Photos, with Gaussian-Splatting Dots
The visuals in the game are built using Gaussian-splatting dots. This technique combines artistic visuals with efficient rendering, creating stylized and optimized 3D environments for the game world.

### AI Powered by Tiny-LLM Running on Local Device
The AI in the game is powered by a lightweight version of the **LLM (Large Language Model)** running locally on the device. This allows for responsive and intelligent gameplay mechanics, including non-player character (NPC) behavior, procedural generation, and dynamic decision-making based on game events.
